This list aims to be comprehensive while at the same time not populated with
unused or defunct compilers. Similarly, the source or target language of any
compiler should be either widely used or if it is an intermediate
representation, must be accepted or targeted by other compilers. If a compiler
is missing from the list that satisfies this criteria, feel free to create a
pull request.
